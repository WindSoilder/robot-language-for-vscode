# robot language README
This is the robotframework for vscode.

## Features
Gramma highlight
Goto definition(For now it is only support for Keyword definition and user defined library definition)

## Requirements
User define system environment variable PY_SITE_PATH, which indicate the site package path, for example:
If your python site package is located in C:\Python27\Lib\Site-Packages.  You can make the PY_SITE_PATH variable 
to this value.  (This environment variable is needed because if your keyword is defined by python, it will search into this
site package and find it's definition.)


## Extension Settings
None

## Known Issues

### Issue 1
Because robot framework support txt file, for this reason, if you are using robot file with txt extension,
you should change the language to robot manually, it is recommended to add vscode setting to robot folder.
For example, if you have a folder named TestSuiteDirectory, which contains test suite files.
Then you can create .vscode folder in TestSuiteDirectory, and create settings.json file, add something like
this:
// Place your settings in this file to overwrite default and user settings.
{
    "files.associations": {
        "*.txt": "robot"
    }
}

### Issue 2
The gramma don't support highlight robot builtin keyword yet.

### Issue 3
It only support robotframework working with python, it don't support java for now.

## Release Notes
Although vscode use promise, I know little about async programming, so some function is implemented
in sync way, so there may have be blocked if you using goto definition in a big test case file or a resource file.

### 0.1.0
Although vscode use promise, I know little about async programming, so some function is implemented
in sync way, so there may have be blocked if you using goto definition in a big test case file or a resource file.
These functions may be fixed to active async way in later version.
