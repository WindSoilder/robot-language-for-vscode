## Requirements
User define system environment variable *PY_SITE_PATH*, which indicate the site package path, for example, if your python site package is located in C:\Python27\Lib\Site-Packages.

You can make the *PY_SITE_PATH* variable to this value.  (This environment variable is needed because if your keyword is defined by python, it will search into this site package and find it's definition.)
